Implementation of K-Means algorithm based on random cluster initialization.
Algorithm adapted to multiple clustering process - a set of data can be divided into a defined number of clusters, each of which newly created clusters can be subdivided again - the process can be repeated. 

For graphical visualization of the clustering process, an additional class has been created, which places on the axes of coordinates points located in individual clusters.
